# WeBuild_const

This was a web development project that I built for a construction company. This website is fully responsive and includes both a front-end and a back-end. Front-End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Back-End: Flask, Mysql Xampp and Chart.js are two useful tools.  Some of the large files could not be uploaded. If you can access my code, then contact me.
